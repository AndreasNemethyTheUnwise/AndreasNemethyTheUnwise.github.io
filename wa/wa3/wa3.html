    <h2 id="subsection">Origins</h2>
    <p>The Peel P50 is a three-wheeled microcar originally made from 1962 to 1965 by the Peel Engineering Company on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isle_of_Man">Isle of Man</a>. Designed as a city car, it was advertised in the 1960s as capable of seating "one adult and a shopping bag." In 1963, as a publicity stunt, a Peel P50 was taken to the top of Blackpool Tower in the lift and driven around the observation balcony.</p>

    <h2 id="subsection">What Even Is A Peel?</h2>
    <p>The Peel Engineering Company was a manufacturing company based in Peel on the west coast of the Isle of Man. Peel Engineering developed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peel_Manxcar">Peel Manxcar concept vehicle</a>, and the Peel P-1000 4 wheeled microcars, and the Peel P50 and Peel Trident 3 wheeled microcars, in addition to the Peel Viking Sport and prototype GRP Minis for BMC. These models constitute the only automobiles manufactured on the Isle of Man; the company ceased manufacture in 1969. The Peel Engineering Company referred to in this article later became Peel Engineering Ltd. Originally launched in 1965, it dissolved in 1974 and the brand relaunched in 2010.</p>

    <h2 id="subsection">Specs Of The Mighty P50</h2>
    <p>The original P50 used a 3 cu in (49.2 cc) DKW single-cylinder engine, which gave it a top speed of approximately 37 mph (60 km/h), and was equipped with a three-speed manual transmission that had no reverse. Consequently, turning in a confined area could be achieved only by pushing, or lifting the car using the handle on the rear and physically pulling it round. The makers and users claim fuel consumption of 100 mpg‑imp (2.8 L/100 km; 83 mpg‑US).
    The vehicle's only door was on its left side and equipment included a single windscreen wiper and one headlight. Standard colours were Daytona White, Dragon Red, and Dark Blue. The 1963 model retailed for £199 when new (about £4433 in 2021).</p>

    <p>In 2010 Peel Engineering Ltd. in England reinstated manufacturing of the P50 and Trident models from its premises in Sutton-in-Ashfield, England. Externally this car is very similar to the original, with the same dimensions and kerb weight as the original, but with mechanical differences in the suspension, steering, and drive-train, and a fully functioning reverse gear, ensuring they are road-legal under today's rules. Production included petrol models with a 49 cc four-stroke engine and electric models with an electric moped motor and gelled-electrolyte batteries. The top speed of both cars is about 28 mph (45 km/h).</p>

    <h2 id="subsection">World's Smallest Car</h2>
    <p>At 54 in (137 cm) long and 39 in (99 cm) wide and with an unladen weight of 130 pounds (59 kg), as of 2021 the P50 holds the record as the smallest car ever to go into production. As demonstrated by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Clarkson">Jeremy Clarkson</a> during a <a href="https://youtu.be/dJfSS0ZXYdo">2007 episode of Top Gear</a>, he drove a blue P50 through the BBC's Television Centre. The original Peel P50 has always been road-legal in the UK, though the many replica versions are classed as Kitcar and as such, require MSVA inspection for 3 wheel Moped or 4 wheel Quadricycle. It is in fact street-legal in the US.</p>

    <h2 id="subsection">What Now?</h2>
    <p>In 2018 it was reported that Peel Engineering sells around fifteen P50s annually, plus ten or so continuations of its bigger sister, the two-seat bubblecar Peel Trident. The conventional piston engined P50 is more requested in the UK, priced at £14,879 – whereas greater demand for the Peel comes from the US, where the electric model (at £13,679) helps owners to comply with emissions regulations. In the Netherlands there are two original Peel Tridents registered as tricycles, but the Trident replica with the 50cc engine and 59 km/h (37 mph) top speed was registered as a moped. In Amsterdam the Ripley's Believe It Or Not museum has one, and in Wassenaar the Louwman Museum had an original P50 on display.
